        <img src="../images/Group 1.png" alt="Mary Li's Bio Image">
        <h2>20-year-old international student from Guangzhou, China, studying in the U.S / Sophermore / My major is Information Management and Technology. </h2>
        <p>I am interested in exploring <strong>how technology transforms</strong> communication, data management, and user experiences in global contexts.</p>
        <p>I love exploring different cultures, especially through food—dim sum and wonton noodles hold a special place in my heart. </p>
        <p>In my free time, you’ll often find me trying out new recipes, binge-watching K-dramas, or revisiting Friends for the hundredth time.</p>
        <p>I enjoy photography and have a habit of taking pictures of small, everyday moments, like a perfectly plated dish or a sunny campus corner. </p>
        <p>Fun fact: I once spent an entire day documenting my mascot’s “adventures” for a class project.</p>
        <p>My family is my biggest inspiration, and I love sharing stories about them and my hometown. One unique thing about me? I can navigate a bustling Chinese street market like a pro but still get lost on my university campus!</p>
