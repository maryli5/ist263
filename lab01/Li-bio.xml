        My major is Information Management and Technology. I am interested in exploring how technology transforms communication, data management, and user experiences in global contexts.

        Outside of work, I am a 20-year-old international student from Guangzhou, China, studying in the U.S. I love exploring different cultures, especially through food—dim sum and wonton noodles hold a special place in my heart. In my free time, you’ll often find me trying out new recipes, binge-watching K-dramas, or revisiting Friends for the hundredth time.
        I enjoy photography and have a habit of taking pictures of small, everyday moments, like a perfectly plated dish or a sunny campus corner. Fun fact: I once spent an entire day documenting my mascot’s “adventures” for a class project.
        My family is my biggest inspiration, and I love sharing stories about them and my hometown. One unique thing about me? I can navigate a bustling Chinese street market like a pro but still get lost on my university campus!
